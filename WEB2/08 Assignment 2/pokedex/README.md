# Semester 4 WEB2 Assignment 2

Note 1: This website is created using pure CSS, no external CSS frameworks were used. Also it works best on the latest chrome
version, I haven't tried them on other websites (some newer CSS selectors are used, like :has() and others, which might
be incompatible with older browser versions)

Note 2: The website is not responsive, it was designed for desktop users.

## Design ideas
- Pokemon list (on the right side): 
  - The movement and the animations came from the popular game <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">Osu!</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/CrASH285">Crash285</a> was helping with the inner design of a list item (a single pokemon) 
- Pokemon detailed view (on the left side):
  - Some parts of this view was inspired by this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6540871-Pokedex-App">beautiful design</a>
