I mostly use CLion for C programming, so the CMake file might be different for me.

### Lesson 3

Some of the solutions for the Lesson3/ex6 are incorrect, the correct
solutions are in the Lesson4/mystr.c (these solutions are unit tested,
I just wanted to leave the old (incorrect) solutions in the Lesson3 so 
that someone can spot it and be happy they found a bug)
