# SEP4 Exercises and Handins

Hi, I'm a student at VIA University College in Horsens, Denmark. As I see some of my classmates having difficulties with some hand-ins and exercises, I decided to upload them here.

If you have a question or a suggestion, or you spot a mistake, feel free to open a new issue or email me at 315279@via.dk (thank you for that)

Other thoughts: this repo was not made to just copy/paste the solutions for the exercises and mark them as done, but to have a plan b if you are stuck and want to get a little help. So please try to do the exercises on your own first!
